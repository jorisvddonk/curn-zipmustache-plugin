curn-zipmustache-plugin
=======================

A plugin for [curn](http://software.clapper.org/curn/) which generates .zip files filled with files rendered via Mustache templates.

Primary use case: turning a set of RSS feeds into a neat epub e-book without having to do some (shell) scripting or nasty hacks to include static files (CSS, etc).

Documentation and examples will follow later.
