curn-zipmustache-plugin
=======================

A plugin for [curn](http://software.clapper.org/curn/) which generates .zip files filled with files rendered via Mustache templates.

Primary use case: turning a set of RSS feeds into a neat epub e-book without having to do some (shell) scripting or nasty hacks to include static files (CSS, etc).

Documentation will follow later. For a basic example, see the 'examples' folder.

# Current status of this project

This project is currently *inactive*. I made this primarily so that I could generate RSS feed ebooks on my Kobo Glo, but the Kobo Glo's software for reading ebooks is somewhat broken, as it doesn't open external links properly on the Kobo webbrowser. Furthermore, there's currently no known way of forcing the Kobo Glo to do a library-autoupdate, which makes working with generated epubs slightly annoying and difficult, sadly..
